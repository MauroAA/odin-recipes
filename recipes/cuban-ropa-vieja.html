    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a recipe from my old grandmother, she used to prepare it for me with great care, it is made of who knows what but I like it and you would like it too.</p>
    <p>All right, let's get started whit the ingredients</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Fork</li>
        <li>medium pot</li>
        <li>Frying pan</li>
        <li>1 pound of beef</li>
        <li>1 beef bouillon cube</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>black pepper and salt to taste</li>
        <li>1 large onion</li>
        <li>1 pepper</li>
        <li>2 or 3 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon cumin powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of oregano (can be fresh or powdered)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>The first step is to soften the meat in a pot, ideally it should be under pressure, for about 30 minutes or until it is very soft so that it is easier to shred it. To do this, add salt to the water and it should cover up to 3 fingers above the height of the meat</li>
        <li>Once the 30 minutes have passed, we check that the piece of meat is ready by inserting a fork into it, if the fork sinks easily when pricking it, it is that it is at the point we want.</li>
        <li>Drain and place the beef in a container until it cools. You can keep the broth to use in other dishes.</li>
        <li>The next thing we will do is take 2 forks and thread it well, we reserve.</li>
        <li>For the sauce, chop the onion and pepper into small squares, crush the garlic cloves well and fry for only 30 seconds in a hot pan with just a teaspoon of oil.</li>
        <li>Add the rest of the ingredients to the sauce, cumin, oregano, red wine, dry wine and tomato puree, stir until everything is well integrated for ½ minute.</li>
        <li>Finally we add the shredded meat and cover well with all the sauce, cook over medium heat for a few seconds and rectify if it is at the point of salt that you like.</li>
        <li>And voila, you already have the delicious old clothes to enjoy whenever you want and pamper your palate.</li>
    </ol>
